Several examples are present in this directory

test: a simple test with a fake parametrisation

pyphyex: examples with the parametrisations from PHYEX (except LIMA)

old: LIMA will soon be included in pyphyex but, in the meantime, an old interfacing code is here.
     Interfacing with WRF is no longer maintained, but is kept here to facilitate its eventual recovery.
